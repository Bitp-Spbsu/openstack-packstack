Description: Utility to install OpenStack on Red Hat based operating system.
        See other branches for older openstack versions
        
        This utility can be used to install openstack on a single or
        group of hosts (over ssh)
        
        This utility is still in the early stages, a lot of the configuration
        options have yet to be added
        
        Installation of packstack:
        $ yum install -y git
        $ git clone git://github.com/stackforge/packstack.git
        $ cd packstack && sudo python setup.py install
        
        Installation of openstack-puppet-modules (REQUIRED if running packstack from source):
        $ sudo python setup.py install_puppet_modules
        
        Option 1 (using answer file)
        $ packstack --gen-answer-file=ans.txt
        
        # then edit ans.txt as appropriate e.g.
        o set CONFIG_SSH_KEY to a public ssh key to be installed to remote machines
        o Edit the IP address to anywhere you want to install a piece of openstack on another server
        o Edit the 3 network interfaces to whatever makes sense in your setup
        
        you'll need to use a icehouse repository for example for RHEL
        CONFIG_REPO=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-icehouse/epel-6/
        
        
        $ packstack --answer-file=ans.txt
        
        Option 2 (prompts for configuration options)
        $ packstack
        
        that's it, if everything went well you can now start using openstack
        $ cd
        $ . keystonerc_admin
        $ nova list
        $ swift list  # if you have installed swift
        
        
        Config options
        CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_HOSTS :
                a comma seperated list of ip addresses on which to install nova compute
        CONFIG_SWIFT_STORAGE_HOSTS :
                a comma seperate list of swift storage devices
                1.1.1.1  : create a testing loopback device and use this for storage
                1.1.1.1/sdb : use /dev/sdb on 1.1.1.1 as a storage device
        
        Logging
        
        The location of the log files and generated puppet manifests are in the
        /var/tmp/packstack directory under a directory named by the date in which
        packstack was run and a random string (e.g. /var/tmp/packstack/20131022-204316-Bf3Ek2).
        Inside, we find a manifest directory and the openstack-setup.log file; puppet
        manifests and a log file for each one are found inside the manifest directory.
        
        Debugging
        
        To make packstack write more detailed information into the log file you can use the -d switch:
        
        $ packstack -d --allinone
